The resort was very modern at the time - a hotel with a concert hall, a dance hall, a theater hall, a restaurant and an outdoor stage, where you could enjoy the summer with symphonic music. Despite the wide range of services, in the early 1930s cultural life moved closer to the city center and “Kūrmāja” lost its great importance in the cultural life of Liepaja, visitors began to prefer theater and opera. The city board had a plan to build a new, more modern building closer to the sea. During this time, only sports competitions took place in “Kūrmāja” (for example, in boxing), but in the winter months “Kūrmāja” was left empty until the second Easter of 1937, when “Kūrmāja” burned down. The causes of the fire were enigmatic, the fire started in the winter garden. It is believed that at that time, some wanderers lived there at night.<br></p></div>`);

When creating the Liepaja Exchange building project, Bertschy was inspired by the Dresden Exchange building, but many believe that the Liepaja Exchange building, which was smaller in size and with a lower degree of luxury, was more balanced and expressive. After its construction, the Liepaja Exchange Association, which was founded in 1881, housed the Exchange building. The Exchange building is considered to be one of the most respectable buildings in terms of both public and economic significance. Already in 1890, clients were served by 40 agencies, 20 commission offices, 4 brokerage and notary offices, 9 export expeditions. On June 27, 1941, this building was demolished.<br></p></div>`);
