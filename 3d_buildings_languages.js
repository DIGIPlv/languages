At the beginning of 1919, the Provisional Government of Latvia and its Prime Minister Kārlis Ulmanis stayed there. The house was built in 1912 and was one of the properties of a wealthy merchant. The house had shops, offices and apartments. When the merchant went bankrupt, he sold the house at Lielās Street 6 to J.Rusinieks, and the building became a watch wholesaler with a factory building in the yard. When Liepaja became the capital of Latvia and the government came here, this house became Kārlis Ulmanis study and meeting room. As a result of the April 16 coup, after which the government of A. Niedra was founded, all institutions of the Latvian government were destroyed. In order to survive, the government was forced to hide on ship "Saratov". In 1934, a memorial plaque was erected near the building on Lielās Street, commemorating the events of the 1919 coup and overcoming them, but the house was destroyed during World War II.<br></p></div>`);
